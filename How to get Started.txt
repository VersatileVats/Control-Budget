In order to run the Final project, do follow the mentioned steps:
	1. Extract the folder and make sure that you place the extracted folder into C:\wamp64\www (because if the project
	   is not in the www folder inside that of wamp, you can't run the project). 

	2. Click on the WAMP SERVER & open the phpMyAdmin. (Make sure that there is no password for phpMyAdmin i.e.
  	   because I have provided no password in the common.php file (which is responsible for establishing connection).
	   Also make sure that while logging in the phpMyAdmin, the username is root and server choice is MySQL.

	3. Then in the left side of phpMyAdmin, click on NEW (to create a new database) and name it as cbudget and in the
	   Collation select latin1_swedish_ci (don't select utf8mb4 or any other) as I have made the sql file with the Collation
	   latin1_swedish_ci. 
     	   NOTE: Please make sure that you name the database as cbudget and the Collation as latin1_swedish_ci
	   If the above properties won't math, then the SQL won't be imported correctly.

	4. Now the new databse cbudget will be created. Click on Import and then choose the SQL file by clicking on CHOOSE FILE.
	   You will have to extract the cbudget.sql file from the extracted project folder. 

	5. Then click on OK. (Other than choosing the file, don't change any other paramters).

	6. Now the SQL file will be imported and you can confirm by seeing the 05 tables in the cbudget database.

	7. Now open the browser (which is compatible with the wamp server and in the url box, write localhost/CtrlBudget/index.php)

	8. Now you will be re-directed to the index.php page (which is the landing page). Now you can use the project as per the need.

For the sake of making things easy, I have done a screen recording in which I have shown how to import the sql and other stuff. As I can't include
the video file in the projecta s it will increase the size of the folder. So I am providing the link fort the video. 
Check out the video: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IqSE_LV8lT9SZDEheR2IiDAGOVv7DCKP?usp=sharing
(It is on my google drive and you can copy the url to see it). 

I have made a flowchart of the directory for the CtrlBudget in Google Drawings so that you can understand the structure of the folder.

I have made another google drawing for the understanding purpose:
